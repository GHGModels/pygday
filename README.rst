Installation
=============

G'DAY model depends on very few other packages, in fact only one I think??

http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html

And replacing this with a small bit of code to read user input files would be
trivial.

Once you have downloaded the source code, or cloned the repository there is 
a simple makefile, e.g.

sudo make install

or

sudo python setup.py install
